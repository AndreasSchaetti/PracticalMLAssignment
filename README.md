# Analysis of Weight Lifting Data Set
This page presents my analysis of the [Weight Lifting Data Set](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har).
This project was conducted as the final assignment of the [Practical Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-machine-learning) on coursera.

The results can be viewed either as [HTML](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/AndreasSchaetti/PracticalMLAssignment/blob/master/weight_lifting.html) or on [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/AndreasSchaetti/PracticalMLAssignment).
